## General Info

This app was an assignment from the coursera specialization Meta iOS Developer. Here is about what was asked for the assignment:
* Main screen showing a list of food item divided into categories.
* Setting screen allowing the user to sort or/and select which food categories they wanted.
* Detail screen showing more information about the item selected.

</p>

I found the assignment interesting but it was missing some more design to be more concrete, I then decided after completing the assignment to redo the UI completely using Figma and making some changes on the available features.

This is what the app looks like now:
